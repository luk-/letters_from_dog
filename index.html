           <p>Dogs would love to speak to you, but they lack the ability to enunciate and converse like a human due to science. Letters from Dog knows how to communicate exactly what your dog is thinking.</p>

	  <h2>How it works<h2>
	   <p>Letters from dog is <i>imagination as a service</i> that sends you real-life imaginary correspondence from your dog.</p>
	   <p>After signing up, you fill out a detailed questionnaire about your dog. What is your dogs favorite food? What types of silly things does your dog do? What are your dogs favorite games? You'll answer questions like these and more so we can get an accurate picture of your dogs personality.</p>
	   <p>Once you've finished your questionnaire, our writing team will get to work constructing personalized correspondence that can only come from your loving dog.</p>
	   <p class="larger"> And then — once a month — you will receive a letter from dog.</p>
